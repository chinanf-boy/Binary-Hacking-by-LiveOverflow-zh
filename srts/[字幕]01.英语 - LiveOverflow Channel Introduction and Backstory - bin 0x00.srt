Welcome to LiveOverflow.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:14,170
Here you can find videos about computer internals,
with a focus on hacking and security concepts.

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,950
I also record myself solving hacking challenges
- it might be a bit boring to watch, but if

4
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:24,959
you always wondered how other people work
and think, it might be interesting for you.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,010
Now let me tell you a short story about why
I am doing this here.

6
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,380
I was too young in the 90s and didn’t exist
in the 80s to be part of the seemingly golden

7
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:37,989
age of the hacker culture.

8
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:42,819
When I was a teenager I loved taking apart
electronics and looking at the green circuit

9
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:46,869
boards wondering with what kind of magic it
is imbued with.

10
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,650
Once my dad brought home our first computers
and we got access to the internet, I found

11
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:56,629
myself being fascinated with “hacking”
and wanted to learn more about it.

12
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,949
But all I found was crap, people trying to
sell old information or fake products.

13
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,659
So I never got into hacking until much later.

14
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:11,399
I started programming in Visual Basic and
made my first websites with html.

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,130
Eventually I moved on to php and other programming
languages.

16
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:22,170
Some years pass and I moved out to another
city to go to university.

17
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,780
One day I was sitting in front of my computer
coming across this hacking game by stripe.

18
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,930
A CTF where one level was to exploit a buffer
overflow.

19
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,650
I knew what a stack was.

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,570
And I was able to read simple assembler code
from university classes.

21
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:45,500
But not until I saw the shell popping up,
my mind being blown and struck in awe, I realized

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,180
I was at a position in life where I can pursue
a dream I had as a kid.

23
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:57,119
And I still wear the T-Shirt I got from the
stripe CTF with pride.

24
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,999
At the same time I had the opportunity to
join a hackerspace where I met so many intelligent

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,240
people and I went down a rabbit hole.

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,500
Not many years have passed since then.

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,590
And I still feel I have only explored a tiny
fraction of what is out there.

28
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,000
The content I am creating here is an attempt
to give anybody who want’s to understand

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,670
the world better, an opportunity to start
somewhere.

30
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,800
I want to give to others, what I wish I found
when I was a teenager sitting in the basement

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,940
typing into google “how to hack”.

32
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,670
At the same time I see more and more people
making tutorials on how to use certain hacking

33
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,860
tools, rather than explaining the underlying
concepts.

34
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,550
I understand that it looks cool, and that
you can feel very powerful.

35
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,950
But there is more to hacking than that.

36
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,750
Understanding concepts, understanding how
your phone and laptop do stuff, understanding

37
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,670
on a technical level how you are able to watch
this video right now.

38
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,230
That is amazing.

39
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,230
There is so much awesome stuff to discover
and break.

40
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,450
So I invite you to join me on this adventure
and “Hack the Planet!”.
