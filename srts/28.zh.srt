1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,340
上一集我们进行了第一次网络挑战，我们首先反向设计了服务器

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,150
is listening on a port and then we connected to it with netcat.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,060
This video we want to go one layer deeper and have a look at the TCP protocol.

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,069
这将是我们第一次看到发送数据包意味着什么

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:25,600
the network.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,950
We have used netcat now multiple times.

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,620
We used it in CTFs and last video to connect to challenges.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,250
And in the web security series we used it to talk to a real webserver.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,000
So you know that netcat is a very handy tool to send tcp packets over the network.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,190
So I suggest we download wireshark to analyse packets we send with netcat.

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,890
When we open wireshark we select the network interface we want to capture packets.

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,770
In this case our traffic doesn’t leave the machine thus we can select the loopback interface.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,480
环回更像是一个虚拟的网络接口，它不是一个真正的物理网卡卡住了

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,750
in your PC.

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,940
Through this interface will go all our traffic that we send around on our local machine.

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,570
And as you may know, the own machine is always identified as localhost or IP 127.0.0.1.

17
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,290
现在让我们使用两个终端窗口，在一个窗口中，我们以监听模式启动netcat。

18
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,970
and we select a port.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,720
在另一个窗口中，我们可以执行netstat，就像在最后一个视频中一样，我们可以列出所有

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,080
processes that are currently listening on a port.

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,240
And here is our netcat process.

22
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,280
你知道吗，让我们用strace来执行netcat服务器，这样我们就可以看到

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,100
syscalls that netcat uses to establish a server.

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,500
所以它将首先创建一个套接字，设置一些选项，然后绑定端口1234，现在正在监听

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,770
on that port and is now waiting for a connection to be established with accept.

26
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,530
It’s basically exactly what we reverse engineered in last video.

27
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,280
我们也可以快速检查wireshark，我们看不到任何数据包通过

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,320
network yet.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Ok.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,210
Now let’s use the second window to connect to this netcat server.

31
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,010
您可以在服务器上看到accept现在返回，因为客户端与

32
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,009
port.

33
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,689
And now, we see three entries in wireshark.

34
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,410
We see a SYN, SYNACK and ACK. packet.

35
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,070
Let’s quickly have a look at those.

36
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,110
As you can see in the lowest window, a packet is just some binary data.

37
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,730
And that binary data has meaning which wireshark can parse and display us nicely.

38
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,680
So above it we can see the decoded packet and it’s divided by layers.

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,890
Because this packet didn’t leave our machine the ethernet layer is just all zeroes.

40
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,200
Usually you would find here your mac address and the mac address from your switch or router.

41
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,200
So that layer is only used between two direct connections.

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,770
Besides the Mac addresses, this layer also contains a TYPE.

43
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:57,550
And the type is set to hex 800, which indicates that the next layer is an IPv4 layer.

44
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,500
Wireshark sees that and knows now how to decode the next bytes.

45
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,640
单击下一层时，wireshark将突出显示包的哪些字节属于

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,780
to that layer.

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,630
然后您可以看到它是如何决定它是一个IPv4，版本4层的，因为

48
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,759
first 4 bits of this byte is 4.

49
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,440
You can also see here the source and destination IP, which in this case is the same.

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,830
因此，当带有MAC地址的以太网层是关于直接连接时，IP层

51
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,260
在互联网上可以包含一个非常远的地址，并且交换机将确保

52
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,440
that this packet is forwarded until you reach that machine.

53
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,290
这个层还包含了关于层的信息，这就是协议

54
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,290
identifier.

55
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,370
In this case it’s 6, which means the content of this IP layer is a TCP header.

56
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,450
IP和TCP通常在一起，这很常见，因此您可能听说过

57
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,790
of TCP/IP before, which just says that there is a TCP layer over an IP layer.

58
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,500
因此，以太网层有助于从一台机器到另一台机器，IP层有助于识别

59
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,900
TCP层现在将帮助识别

60
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,040
program or process on this machine should handle this packet.

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,500
And that is identified with the port number.

62
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,650
You can see here that the destination port is set to 1234.

63
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:24,210
您还可以在这里看到一个源端口，这是必需的，这样您就可以从

64
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,480
this server.

65
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,859
所以当服务器用一个包响应时，它将使用这个端口，这样客户端

66
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,330
machine knows which process gets this response.

67
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,000
And that’s usually a random high port number.

68
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:41,059
不管怎样，现在我们了解了完整的TCP包是如何构造的，现在让我们来看看

69
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,530
the protocol.

70
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:48,379
A Protocol just refers to a set of rules on how to talk to another computer.

71
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,940
If a client and server agree on how to send data back and forth, it will work.

72
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,160
So What we will see now is just what somebody came up with in order to create a data connection.

73
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:05,509
请记住，目前我们还没有向netcat发送任何数据，到目前为止，我们只建立了

74
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:06,649
a connection.

75
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:10,909
Ok, so we see that 3 packets were exchanged.

76
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:15,459
First the client sent a so called SYN packet, a synchronize packet.

77
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,230
And then the server responded with an SYN,ACK packet.

78
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,079
Meaning I acknowledge that I received it.

79
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,650
This is important because maybe the initial packet didn’t arrive.

80
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,860
So when you as a client get a response, you know that the server got your message.

81
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,200
This means the client knows now that the connection works.

82
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,199
但是从服务器的角度来看，服务器还不知道发送

83
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,129
packet was successful.

84
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:45,179
Maybe the server can only receive but not send packets.

85
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,260
因此，客户机将用一个ACK包响应SYN、ACK包，确认

86
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:57,989
它得到了服务器的回答，现在双方都确定，是的，我成功地交换了数据包

87
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,140
with this other machine, now we can talk data.

88
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,489
And this is all done transparently.

89
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,520
You didn’t have to construct these packets yourself.

90
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,500
You simply opened a socket and waited for a connection.

91
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,499
Ok.

92
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:13,889
Now let’s send some data from the client to the server.

93
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,249
You can see that immediately the server was able to read the line you sent.

94
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,940
How does that look in wireshark.

95
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:23,499
We see two new packets.

96
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:27,619
A PSH packet from the client to the server, and an ack packet back.

97
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:31,369
The packet from the client also now has an additional DATA layer.

98
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:35,259
And that data layer just contains the raw bytes we sent.

99
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:39,919
服务器用ACK响应，通知客户端包成功

100
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,919
received.

101
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,159
Now let’s send a response from the server.

102
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:49,399
你看，服务器只是把文本写到文件描述符4，它是文件描述符

103
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,771
that accept returned.

104
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,470
如您所见，应用程序只需写入该paseudo文件、该套接字和

105
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,460
magic below sent that over the network.

106
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:04,389
现在让我们看看它做了什么，它还发送了一个psh包和客户机

107
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,969
acknwoledged the arrival with an ack packet back.

108
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,359
One more more thing.

109
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,980
Obviously the size of a packet is limited.

110
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,709
所以当你发送大量数据时会发生什么，比如说你上传了一个巨大的文件，

111
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,759
那怎么办？

112
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,280
Let’s just copy a bunch of characters and send them.

113
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,569
Ahhh, see, now there are more than just two packets.

114
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:30,069
在开发应用程序时，您不会看到它，但在内核、网卡或

115
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,099
driver, I don’t really know, it got split up.

116
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:37,339
您还可以看到第二个包没有与第一个包一起发送，第二个包

117
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:41,639
packet was only sent out once the server acknowledges the first one.

118
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,279
Let’s see what happens when you kill the client.

119
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,909
即使我们只是ctrl+c netcat，我们也可以在wireshark中看到，fin包已经发送了

120
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:53,219
out, do indicate we are done with this channel.

121
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:57,939
You can free up your resources and you don’t have to expect more packets from this connection.

122
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,330
And like during setup, there are 3 packets exchanged.

123
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,320
服务器通过客户机确认fin，现在客户机知道，服务器知道

124
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,799
that it is done.

125
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,140
但是服务器还不知道客户机是否知道它已经完成了，所以它也

126
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,439
responds with an ack.

127
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,739
Now both now that it’s over.

128
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,130
Now this whole exchange is referred to as a TCP stream.

129
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:26,849
We established a connection, then exchanged data back and forth, and then quit the connection.

130
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:32,619
And wireshark allows us to investigate this stream, for example with Follow TCP stream.

131
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,070
Here only the data is visible and color coded who sent what.

132
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,500
现在您应该从Web安全系列中观看我的HTTP协议视频，因为

133
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,160
you will understand now much better what it means to have a server and client.

134
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,080
And that HTTP is just data sent over TCP, exactly how we sent these messages.

135
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:56,469
浏览器和Web服务器只是一些特殊的程序，它们用特殊的

136
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,860
messages received over TCP.
