1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,990
Let’s head into the final levels of exploit-exercises protostar.

2
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:10,279
These levels are a little bit more developed and are on the level of very easy pwnable

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,140
CTF challenges.

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:18,099
Let’s have a look at final level 0.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,190
The network setup is basically the same like from the previous challenges, so if you are

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,369
not familiar with these custom functions you should watch the previous videos where we

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,900
figure out what they do.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,340
So, when a client connects to this service running on port 2995, it will call this function

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,290
get_username.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,190
This function has a local 512 byte big buffer which is overwritten with 0.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,190
Then gets is used to read data from the user into the buffer.

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,330
And as we have learned many episodes ago, gets is a dangerous function.

13
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:53,319
So this is obviously our buffer overflow.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,970
Then it checks if there is a newline or carriage return and if so, would overwrite it with

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,690
a 0.

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:06,180
After that is a loop, which will go over the buffer and call toupper on every character.

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,110
Then the function returns.

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,400
This means we should be able to overwrite the return pointer of this function and redirect

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,340
code execution.

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,680
We only have one issue, and that is that the data we would use to overflow would be transformed

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,360
to uppercase.

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,770
This means our shellcode, as well as the address we use to overwrite the instruction pointer

23
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,070
on the stack have to not change when toupper is used.

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,420
Meaning, you cannot use lower-case ascii characters.

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,130
Or is there maybe a trick how we can get around this restriction?

26
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,740
Let’s think about this and work our way backwards.

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:49,730
So what condition has to be true in order that toupper is not used on our input.

28
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:56,129
Well the for loop uses strlen to determine on how many bytes it will do this.

29
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,200
And strlen counts all bytes until in finds a null byte.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,340
So if we manage to somehow get a null byte before our actual overflow and shellcode,

31
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,480
we would be fine.

32
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,059
Ok, how could we get a null byte in there.

33
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,350
If you check the man page of gets you will see, that gets reads everything until it a

34
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,079
newline or EOF.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,690
This means gets will have no issue of reading a null-byte.

36
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,690
Easy.

37
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,490
So we can completly ignore the to uppercase stuff.

38
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,200
And just for creativity reasons, you could also abuse the null-byte replacement of the

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
carriage return.

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,650
Let’s say the input would use strcpy, thus also stopping at a null byte, you could use

41
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,740
a carriage return instead, which will then afterwards get replaced by a null byte.

42
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,150
So that would also work.

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,260
The buffer is 512 bytes big, so let’s use that knwoledge to create a simple proof of

44
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,210
concept buffer overflow.

45
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,899
We can use python with -c, to directly write a short script in the argument.

46
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,810
So we could print like 510 lowercase a, and then we can later see that these were modified

47
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,710
to be uppercase.

48
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,149
Then we append a nullbyte and continue with a typical alphabet so we can recognize how

49
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,150
to overflow the instruction pointer.

50
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,780
We can also make the alphabet lowercase, to proof that it will not be transformed to uppercase

51
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,320
after the nullbyte.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,090
Like with the previous networking challenges we can connect to the service on port 2995

53
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,380
with netcat.

54
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:31,909
So we can simply pipe the output of our python one-liner to netcat as well.

55
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:36,259
We don’t see the output “No such user… “ like before.

56
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:42,760
And the code shows us that it would be printed after the return in main, thus we can assume

57
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,770
we successfully overwrote the instruction pointer and crashed the program.

58
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,399
But how do we debug this now?

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,920
If you have a look at the description of the protostar VM, you will see here a headline

60
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,980
called core files.

61
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,910
It says that the filename pattern is set to /tmp/ something.

62
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,139
This means that core dumps are stored in tmp.

63
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,030
And when we have a look at the content of /tmp/ we will see a core file we just produced.

64
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,080
They belong to root, so let’s switch to root so we can work with them.

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,700
But what are core files?

66
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,620
Let’s ask the linux manual with `man core`.

67
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,020
The default action of certain signals is to cause a process to terminate and produce a

68
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,990
core dump file, a disk file containing an image of the process's memory at the time

69
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,000
of termination.

70
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:37,559
This sounds good, if we get the state of the memory when it crashed, we should be able

71
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:41,599
to get a lot of information about our buffer overflow.

72
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,009
This image can be used in a debugger (e.g., gdb(1)) to inspect the state of the program

73
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:48,949
at the time that it terminated.

74
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:54,209
Oh wow, we can use gdb to look at these and we area already very familiar with how to

75
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,080
use gdb.

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,270
A list of the signals which cause a process to dump core can be found in signal(7).

77
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,010
Ok, interesting.

78
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:09,999
Apparently the process received a signal because it did produce a core file, right?

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,530
So to understand this properly, let’s also try to understand what signals are.

80
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:17,779
Notice the 7 in brackets after signal, this is important to reference the correct page

81
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,489
about signal in the manual.

82
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,500
so `man 7 signal`.

83
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,480
Let’s have a look at the standard signals further down.

84
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,009
Linux supports the standard signals listed below.

85
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:34,599
Several signal numbers are architecture-dependent, as indicated in the "Value" column.

86
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:38,539
Mhh, so signals can be different on different architectures.

87
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:43,779
So if it is an intel, arm or sparc processor this might make a difference, bug generally

88
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:49,649
this tells us, that signals could have something to do with very low-level CPU and hardware

89
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,649
features.

90
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:53,219
Let’s have a look at the list of signals.

91
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:58,939
For example SIGINT is a signal you have used many many times, it’s an interrupt from

92
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,720
the keyboard, this happens when you press control+C.

93
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:07,709
Or remember how you sometimes can get illegal instruction when you jump into invalid code,

94
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,440
a SIGILL, that’s also a signal.

95
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,939
Which obviously must have been triggered from the CPU which couldn’t make sense of an

96
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:15,939
instruction.

97
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,679
Or our favorite syscall, SIGSEGV, a segfault.

98
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:24,219
Trigegred from an illigel memory reference, for example when you jump to non-existing

99
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:25,219
memory.

100
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,719
Or try to write to non existing memory.

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,990
Which obviously is also triggered by low level hardware when you try to execute bad stuff.

102
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,560
This line here is also interesting: The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught, blocked,

103
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,779
or ignored.

104
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,839
This means most of these signals can be caught by the process.

105
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:51,329
You have actually experience this before too, when you run a process in gdb, and you forgot

106
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,260
to set a breakpoint and the process is just running, you can use CTRL+C to break back

107
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:57,259
into gdb.

108
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:02,309
You sent a SIGINT to the process which instead of quitting, had a signal handler set up to

109
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:05,219
catch it and perform a different action.

110
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,780
So signals are kind of like interrupts for processes by the kernel.

111
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:15,349
Certain events like memory access fails, pressing CTRL+C or also killing a process causeses

112
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,469
the kernel to send a signal to a process.

113
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:23,589
Unhandled signals usually cause the process to die, but a process can also set up signal

114
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:28,059
handlers to perform certain actions when it receives these signals.

115
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,059
So.

116
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:35,099
In our case, when we overflow EIP on the stack, and the function returns a segmentation fault

117
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,019
is raised and a signal is triggered.

118
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,050
The process doesn’t handle it and is killed by the kernel.

119
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:46,430
At the same time a core dump file is created to save the state of the process that caused

120
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:47,649
this signal.

121
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,599
So now let’s use gdb to see what happened.

122
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:57,469
Like before you simply specify the binary as a first argument but then you add the core

123
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:58,539
file as a second argument.

124
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:04,439
And you see immediately when gdb opens, the message that the process terminated due to

125
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,499
signal 11, a segmentation fault.

126
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:11,449
We can also look at the registers and see the value of eip.

127
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,199
And those are definitely our characters we have entered.

128
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,849
We can also explore the stack with examining the stack pointer.

129
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:22,779
You can see that having these core files is extremely useful.

130
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,720
Now we know which characters caused an overflow and we can now calculate the offset to the

131
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:30,249
instruction pointer on the stack.

132
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:35,729
Another way to debug this further is to use gdb to attach to the already running process.

133
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,749
Make sure you are root.

134
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,430
Simply find the process id and call gdb with -p and the pid.

135
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:48,080
As you can see the process is currently in accept waiting for a client to connect.

136
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:51,169
But when we send our PoC overflow, we don’t see a segfault.

137
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,500
That’s because if you remember, this process creates a fork, a new process, to handle the

138
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
client.

139
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,330
And we always stay in the parent.

140
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:03,559
But we can set in gdb the follow-fork-mode to child, and when we now continue and send

141
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,970
the long input, we get the segfault.

142
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,400
Awesome, now you have everything in place to develop the full exploit.
