1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,910
In this episode we start to get a little bit
closer to a full buffer overflow.

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,370
In the last episode we have learned how a
Buffer Overflow can change local variables,

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,230
which are stored on the stack.

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,000
Now we will have a look at stack level 3,
which is very similar.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,470
If you forgot how we were able to solve stack
level 0, you should go back and watch it again.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,600
When we look at this code, we see that it
is basically the same.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,830
The only difference is the name, instead of
a modified variable, we have the fp variable,

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,110
which is defined as a function pointer.

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,970
The syntax looks a bit ugly, but if you check
the if case, it simply checks if fp is not

10
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,770
zero, and then just calls fp, as if it were
a function.

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,350
Now you know that a function has an address
location in memory.

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,470
So it will basically call whatever address
is stored in fp.

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,810
Now like the modified variable in stack0,
the function pointer fp gets set to 0 and

14
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,050
after the gets function it will be checked
if it’s not zero anymore.

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,900
So we know that fp must also be stored on
the stack.

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,360
As a hint it says, that we can use gdb or
objhump to determine where the win() function

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,100
lies in memory.

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,490
So first let’s use gdb and you can use examine
or print to get the address of win.

19
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,250
Then set the disassembly flavor to intel and
disassemble main.

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,120
Exactly like stack0, we can see that it makes
space for hex 60 bytes on the stack.

21
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,279
Then we set esp offset 5c to 0, so that is
the location of the fp variable.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,790
After the gets, we compare the value if it
is still 0 and if that were not the case,

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,310
we load the value into eax down here, and
call that address.

24
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,860
So let’s set a breakpoint at this call.

25
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,800
Now execute it and enter enough characters
to overwrite this value on the stack.

26
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,769
Exactly like last video.

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,140
Ok we hit the breakpoint, let’s look at
the registers, and we can see, that we have

28
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,870
succesfully set eax to 41414141, which is
the ascii value of capital A.

29
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,749
And the next instruction tries to call this
address.

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,590
So basically jump there.

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,950
But that is obviously invalid memory, se we
get a Segmentation fault.

32
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,080
Now open a second ssh session.

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,120
And create a python script, that will be our
exploit.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,040
So let’s first try to figure out which offset
controls eax.

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,070
So simply print a recognizable pattern.

36
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,120
For example the alphabet.

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,740
Ok. cool.

38
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,089
So pipe this output in a file.

39
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,390
Now you can use this file in gdb as input.

40
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,760
So we dont have to type it everytime, it will
use the content of that file as input.

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,900
Now “run” and use the arrow left to redirect
the file contents in the standard-input of

42
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,500
the program.

43
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,920
Ok so eax it’s hex 51, and that is a capital
Q.

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,700
So now we know which offset modifies eax.

45
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,700
let’s rewrite the code a little bit.

46
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,970
Let’s call this part up to the “Qs”
- padding.

47
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,740
So now we want to write here the address of
the win function.

48
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,040
So simply use backslash x as hex escape for
those byte values.

49
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,080
Oh oops.

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
That doesn fit.

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,170
There is a leading 0 missing.

52
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,980
Save, write the file.

53
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,880
And check it in gdb.

54
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,879
Huh?

55
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,179
segementation fault?

56
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,270
The address looks a bit weird.

57
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,929
Looks like it’s the wrong way around?

58
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,300
Well, that is because of the endianess.

59
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,910
So the numerical value will be basically the
other way around.

60
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:32,909
cool.

61
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,589
Eax looks fine now.

62
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,160
let’s continue and we get code flow successfully
changed!

63
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,729
Now let’s quickly solve the next level as
well.

64
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,430
This level is our first buffer overflow, where
we take advantage of the stack layout.

65
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,610
The code doesn’t contain much.

66
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,210
There is no function pointer variable we could
overwrite.

67
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,159
And now modified variable.

68
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,350
But it still wants us to execute win.

69
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,940
So how do we do that?

70
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,080
Now do you remember how the stack looks like
from last video?

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,390
Here is a quick recap:

72
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,890
So here on the left you can see the assembler
code.

73
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,130
And on the right I will illustrate the stack.
with the 3 important registers, the instruction

74
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:16,949
pointer EIP, the stack pointer ESP and the
base pointer EBP.

75
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,280
So first it starts somewhere else with a ‘call
main’.

76
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,970
Call will push the theoretically next instruction
pointer onto the stack.

77
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,870
And then jump to our main function.

78
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,960
As you can see, when the address of the next
instruction was pushed, the stack pointer

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,000
got incremented and the address placed there.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,940
So now comes our push EBP.

81
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,660
How do we now know where to return to from
main?

82
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,800
Well if you remember, call pushed the address
of the instruction after the call.

83
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,800
So the next value on the stack is where we
want to return to.

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,780
And the ret instruction is basically just
popping this address into the instruction

85
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,960
pointer.

86
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,560
And thus jumping back where we came from.

87
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,030
So as you can see, when a function is called,
the address where we want to return to, will

88
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,810
be stored on the stack.

89
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,000
So instead of overflowing a local variable,
we can simply overflow the return pointer

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,320
on the stack.

91
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,090
And when main would return, it would read
the wrong value and jump there instead.

92
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,410
So let’s use the code that we have just
written, and modify it a bit.

93
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:29,390
Let’s make the payload a bit longer and
simply throw it at this program in gdb.

94
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:35,769
Segmentationfault in hex 54, so we succsefully
redirected code execution, to bad memory.

95
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,530
And if you look closely you can also spot
that the basepointer is hex 53.

96
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,450
So that one was also overwritten, because
if you remember from last video, the old basepointer

97
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,919
is also stored on the stack, right before
the instruction pointer.

98
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,109
And hex 54 is T. So T allows us to control
the instruction pointer.

99
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,210
This time let’s use objdump to find the
address of the win function.

100
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,540
With -t we get all symbols, and then we can
grep for win.

101
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:04,539
So there is our address.

102
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:05,539
Now let’s modify our exploit code.

103
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,989
Let’s remove everything up to the S, because
that is the base pointer.

104
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,180
Now create two variables ebp and eip.

105
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,110
We don’t care about EBP so we can just set
it to whatever we want.

106
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,240
And next we want to set the instruction pointer.

107
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,820
But let me show a better way to encode the
address as a string.

108
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,250
So import struct.

109
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,880
And then you can use struct.pack, to convert
the address from the integer number into a

110
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,550
binary string.

111
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,480
Then print the padding and append the ebp
and eip variable.

112
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,949
so let’s execute this exploit and pipe it
into the stack4 level.

113
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,449
Codeflow was successfully changed!

114
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:41,639
Amazing.

115
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,979
We smashed the stack and controlled the instruction
pointer.

116
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,339
But you still get a segementation fault?

117
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,530
The reason for that is, that after the win
function is complete, it tries to return to

118
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,130
the next value on the stack, which is now
some gibberish, and likely not in a valid

119
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,520
code area.

120
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,490
So it will crash eventually.

121
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,070
But we don’t care, because we executed what
we wanted.

122
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,380
In the next video we will write our first
buffer overflow with shellcode, which will

123
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,290
show you how powerful a buffer overflow can
be.

124
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,020
And it will be our first exploit that will
get us root privileges.
