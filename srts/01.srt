Welcome to LiveOverflow.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,060
Here you can find videos about computer internals，with a focus on hacking and security concepts.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,600
I also record myself solving hacking challenges - it might be a bit boring to watch, but if

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,220
you always wondered how other people work and think, it might be interesting for you.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,760
Now let me tell you a short story about why I am doing this here.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,180
I was too young in the 90s and didn’t exist in the 80s to be part of the seemingly golden age of the hacker culture.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:46,620
When I was a teenager I loved taking apart electronics and looking at the green circuit

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,460
boards wondering with what kind of magic it is imbued with.

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,560
Once my dad brought home our first computers and we got access to the internet, I found

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,100
myself being fascinated with “hacking” and wanted to learn more about it.

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,940
But all I found was crap, people trying to sell old information or fake products.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,960
So I never got into hacking until much later.

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,140
I started programming in Visual Basic and made my first websites with html.

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,140
Eventually I moved on to php and other programming languages.

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,820
Some years pass and I moved out to another city to go to university.

17
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,920
One day I was sitting in front of my computer coming across this hacking game by stripe.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,760
A CTF where one level was to exploit a buffer overflow.

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,220
I knew what a stack was. And I was able to read simple assembler code from university classes.

21
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,060
But not until I saw the shell popping up, my mind being blown and struck in awe, I realized

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,660
I was at a position in life where I can pursue a dream I had as a kid.

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,740
And I still wear the T-Shirt I got from the stripe CTF with pride.

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
At the same time I had the opportunity to join a hackerspace where I met so many intelligent

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,160
people and I went down a rabbit hole.

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,000
Not many years have passed since then.

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,900
And I still feel I have only explored a tiny fraction of what is out there.

28
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,300
The content I am creating here is an attempt to give anybody who want’s to understand

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,400
the world better, an opportunity to start somewhere.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,340
I want to give to others, what I wish I found when I was a teenager sitting in the basement

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,780
typing into google “how to hack”.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,600
At the same time I see more and more people making tutorials on how to use certain hacking

33
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,560
tools, rather than explaining the underlying concepts.

34
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,180
I understand that it looks cool, and that you can feel very powerful.

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,560
But there is more to hacking than that.

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,000
Understanding concepts, understanding how your phone and laptop do stuff, understanding

37
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,760
on a technical level how you are able to watch this video right now.

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,180
That is amazing.

39
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,360
There is so much awesome stuff to discover and break. So I invite you to join me on this adventure and “Hack the Planet!”.
