1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,669
This is the 10th episode.

2
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:12,689
And as you can see in the title, I am counting
the episodes in hexadecimal.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,280
I am wondering if the google algorithm will
screw this up with the suggested next video

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,339
is wrong.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,180
Anyway, I want to explain in this video why
hexadecimal is cool and why you should use

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,110
it, when it comes to computers.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,350
I will also show you how I convert values
back and forth and how I often work with them.

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,350
Ok.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,350
So.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,230
our computers work in binary, 0s and 1s.

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,550
Because it is a representation of the physical
behaviour of our circuits that we have transistors,

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,140
that are like switches and they are either
turned on or off.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,790
A single value that is either 0 or 1 is called
a bit.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,150
You may know that a byte is 8 bits.

15
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:53,939
But maybe you wonder why that is.

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,040
Well, this was not always the case.

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,820
Early computers might have had 6 bits per
byte.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,350
That we use 8 bits for a byte nowadays is
just how history turned out.

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,330
It was IBMs fault with the System 360 that
heavily pushed for an 8-bit byte.

20
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:13,769
Also some people say octad instead of byte
to make clear that they mean 8 bit.

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,480
An interesting example is ascii, because you
will notice that it actually only uses 7bit.

22
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,829
But because we now generally use 8bit bytes,
we kind of waste the first bit.

23
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:28,259
We humans grew up with the decimal system.

24
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,829
We are used to counting with symbols from
0 to 9.

25
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,129
But that is rather arbitrary.

26
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,160
Sure, we have 10 fingers.

27
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,439
But we could also count in 12ths, because
we have 12 finger bones and we can use the

28
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,169
thumb to point to which number we are at.

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,490
This is the Duodecimal system and we actually
use it on our clock.

30
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,450
So If you would have grown up with counting
in hex or binary, it would feel as natural

31
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,450
to you.

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,600
Instead of thinking of numbers as something
fixed, think of it as a tool.

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,710
And you can use whichever number system makes
sense for a particular problem.

34
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,349
So our computers work with bits.

35
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:08,520
And for our modern computers we have defined
that we generally work with bytes of 8 bits.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,220
And 16bit, 32bit or 64bit architectures just
play with this value to keep it nicely divisible

37
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,179
by 8.

38
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:24,480
When we look at data as raw bits: 0000 0000,
we quickly see that a byte takes a lot of

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,850
space if we display it in that way.

40
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,959
Maybe decimal would be a cool representation.

41
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,949
It certainly would take less space to display
them.

42
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,760
I will use python now to show you how we can
convert binary to decimal numbers.

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,600
We simply say that this string represents
a number in base 2.

44
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,579
Let’s do it for a couple of examples with
a simple for loop.

45
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,199
Ok.

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,820
Well.

47
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,889
Takes less space.

48
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:01,200
Though, it kinda bothers me that the biggest
value with 8 bits, is a weird number in decimal.

49
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,270
A number without any interesting properties
or meanings.

50
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:07,589
Let’s have a look at those numbers in hex.

51
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:14,300
Hex numbers use symbols from 0-9 and A-F to
describe a number.

52
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:17,419
We can extend our loop in python.

53
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:24,420
And now you can see how pretty hexadecimal
numbers are to represent 8 bits.

54
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,290
The biggest 8 bit value is also the biggest
value in hex that can be represented by two

55
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,540
digits.

56
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,940
If we would add 1 more bit, so that we have
9 bits, we would also have to add another

57
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:37,359
character.

58
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:42,449
And not only that, if you look closely, it
also nicely represents the two individual

59
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,620
nibbles, that means 4 bits.

60
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,110
So a 8 bit number in hex can be represented
by 2 symbols.

61
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,140
And each symbol refers to one nibble.

62
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:57,509
So this makes it very very clear and easy
to read.

63
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,500
And now you can understand why the decimal
representation is not very fitting for this

64
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,120
kind of stuff.

65
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,030
Can you tell me what is the maximum number
that an unsigned 32bit integer can represent?

66
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,650
Well I don’t know in decimal.

67
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:17,510
I just know that 32bit is 4 times 8 bit and
thus max int is 0xFFFFFFFF.

68
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,070
Now let me quickly show you some cool tricks
with python to convert stuff back and forth.

69
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,290
Python has some builtin functions to convert
numbers.

70
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,269
For example hex() and bin().

71
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,330
And also to parse a binary or hex number with
the int() function and specifying which base

72
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,960
it is.

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,400
If you have a binary string, this means that
maybe not every value in this string is a

74
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,750
nice ascii printable character, you can use
encode and decode on the string to get the

75
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,050
hex representation of the characters.

76
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,390
So hex 41 is a capital ‘A’ in ascii.

77
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:54,579
A much more powerful and important functionality
is offered by python structs.

78
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,570
Which I use all the time when I deal with
binary data.

79
00:04:58,569 --> 00:04:59,999
First import struct.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,980
And then we can use struct.unpack on our data.

81
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:07,759
In this case I define that this data is an
unsigned Integer.

82
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,769
And you can see I can convert this binary
data now to an integer number.

83
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:20,460
If you look closely you may wonder why the
capital A seems to be at the end of the number.

84
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,160
The reason for that is that we have a little-endian
system.

85
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,670
bit’s can be interpreted in two ways.

86
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:30,539
Either the first or the last bit can refer
to the least-significant bit.

87
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,149
I think the picture on wikipedia makes this
very clear.

88
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,190
This can be very important when you receive
data from a big-endian system, because then

89
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,570
you have to be careful how you interpret this
data.

90
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,739
But with python struct it’s easy and we
can define as which endian system we want

91
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,970
to interpret this data.

92
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,540
If you watch some of my CTF exploitation challenge
videos, you will see me using python structs

93
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,759
a lot.

94
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,540
Because it’s great to convert addresses
and other data back and forth.

95
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,800
For example if we want to overwrite an address,
we have to supply the data as a string.

96
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,760
So we can use struct.pack and pack a number
as a binary string.

97
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,269
So the hexadecimal system makes working with
computers much more simple and you should

98
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,270
get used to it.

99
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,700
But we just talked about positive numbers.

100
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,989
From 0 to 0xFF.

101
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,980
But how can we represent negative numbers.

102
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,500
Maybe you have heard of the signed bit, that
the first bit tells you if it is a negative

103
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
number or not.

104
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,850
Though, it’s not as simple as simply reading
the remaining 7 bit and decide if it’s positive

105
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,479
or negative based on the first one.

106
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,739
-1 is actually 0xFF.

107
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,560
Well it does have the first bit set, but it’s
not -127.

108
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,200
This wheel maybe makes it a bit more clear
how negative numbers are actually interpreted.

109
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,409
The operation to convert their absolute value
into the negative value, so for example 255

110
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:58,499
(0xFF) to -1 is called Two’s complement,
you can read that on wikipedia.

111
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:08,730
And you can also very easily negate a given
number by negating all bits and adding 1.

112
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,009
Many functions return -1 on error.

113
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,699
At first it sounds weird, but now you know
that this is just all Fs.

114
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:21,159
So when you read data and you only get 1s
(or Fs in hex) you might read an errror.

115
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,969
What about numbers with a fraction.

116
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,970
Well.

117
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,970
Don’t get me started on that.

118
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,600
It get’s really ugly.

119
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,779
But you can guess that representing a value
with many digits behind the comma can get

120
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,480
very creative if you have only 0s and 1s.

121
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,310
Now before we end let’s get a summary of
the terminology:

122
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,640
we start with a bit.

123
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,019
0 or 1.

124
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,140
4 bits are a nibble.

125
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,829
8 bits are a byte.

126
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,540
And in hexadecimal we can represent a byte
with two digits.

127
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,829
on 32bit architecture a word refers to 32bit
or 4 bytes.

128
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,080
But on 64bit architecture a word is 64bit,
or 8 bytes.

129
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,830
And a double word is obviously the double
amount of that.

130
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,910
As you can see, a computer only has bits.

131
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,420
And how we deal with those bits is up to our
interpretation.

132
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,419
I know this was a bit shorter and less technical
video, but I thought it fits and next time

133
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,579
we will dive deep and exploit our first buffer
overflow.
