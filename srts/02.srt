1
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,310
The first thing we have to do, is to install
an operating system that allows us to easy

2
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:15,489
understand how the whole system works. Windows
and OSX are closed systems that make it very

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,930
hard to understand on a technical level. Though,
actually, OSX is very similar to Linux and

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,730
a lot of concepts can be transferred. But
we will use Linux, because we can for example

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,620
have a look at the Linux Kernel sourcecode
to dig deeper. And also most people come from

6
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,039
a different OS - namely windows or mac - so
it will be cool to learn something new.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,510
There are many many distributions of Linux
that all have their own flavour. For example

8
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,170
there is Kali Linux (formerly backtrack),
which is a Linux operating system that has

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,610
a lot of preinstalled tools intended for penetration
testing. There are other Linux distributions

10
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:56,569
that are more aimed to be used as a standard
desktop environment for example Ubuntu.

11
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,110
A lot of people run Debian on a server to host
some websites. And big companies that need

12
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,269
operating systems with support and service
contracts they often use Red Hat Enterprise Linux

13
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,280
And I know many people that build their
own Linux experience with Archlinux. And there

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,440
are hundreds of other distributions out there.
So just google them.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,750
When you want to first check out Linux,
it’s difficult to decide what to go for.

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,330
I generally just suggest go with Ubuntu. It’s
a very popular distribution, it's easy to

17
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,360
use because it’s kinda aimed at people that
have never used Linux before. So that is what

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,340
we will do.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,430
But if you are already experienced with Linux,
why not take a weekend and checkout archlinux

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,070
and build your system from ground up. You
will fail the first time, but learn a lot.

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,850
So I will install Ubuntu as a Virtual Machine.
It makes it easier for me to record and create

22
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:55,180
those videos, but it also shows another important
tool that is often used for security research,

23
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,140
because you can quickly setup new systems
to test something. Oftentimes you only have

24
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,720
one physical device, but with VMs you can
just run a lot of different systems on a single

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,680
machine.

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,000
So first download and install the VMWare Workstation
Player. As you can see you can download it

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,310
for Linux or Windows. If you are on a Mac
you might want to try VMWare Fusion but it

28
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,320
only has a 30 day trial. Or alternatively
use Virtual Box.

29
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,299
Then download the Ubuntu 64bit LTS version.
If you want you can make sure that you have

30
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:29,199
the same version like I do, but it doesn’t
really matter.

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,000
This is the VMWare Player and it is like a
computer inside your computer. It emulates

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,410
a real PC. Basically you simply create a virtual
hard drive and install anything you like on

33
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:44,959
it. We will use this to install and run Linux
as a so called guest operating system, which

34
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,139
runs inside the real operating system.

35
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,050
Now let’s create a new Virtual Machine.
This will launch a wizard for easy installation,

36
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,659
but we will install the OS ourselves. Then
select Linux as Operating System and also

37
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:01,929
specify Ubuntu 64-bit. If you wanted to install
a different Linux distribution, try to find

38
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,400
it in the list, if it's not there just select
Other Linux and select the matching kernel

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,050
version. Give it a name and just use the default
settings.

40
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:18,259
Imagine this to be like a real physical computer.
To install Linux or another operating system

41
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:24,330
on it you would have to insert the installation
medium. So we will insert the the ubuntu .iso

42
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,969
into the virtual CD drive.

43
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:31,409
When we now start the VM, it will boot from
the CD and guides us through the installation.

44
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:35,499
There are no important settings for us here
right now, so just click next. In a later

45
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:45,509
video I want to explain what partitions are,
but for now just ignore it and continue.

46
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,760
After the installation you have to restart
the machine, but make sure to remove the installation

47
00:03:49,760 --> 00:04:00,710
medium again, so it can boot from the hard
drive where it was installed.

48
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:06,679
Login and welcome to Linux. First thing you
notice is that the window is inconveniently

49
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,260
small, so we want to increase it. We can use
the search field to find the display settings,

50
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,730
but the menu doesn’t have the option to
set it ta proper 16:9 ratio we want. The 16:10

51
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,480
ratio is slightly too big and we have scroll
bars. So let’s go crazy and immediately

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,320
check out the command line to fix this. The
archlinux wiki is a great place to learn more

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,200
about commands that you use. So it tells us
that xrandr is a tool that allows us to configure

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,140
the monitor. Two open the terminal click on
the top left and type in Terminal in the search

55
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:45,940
bar. And those two commands just add a new
option for 1920x1080. Now we also see the

56
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,390
option in the display settings.

57
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,890
Cool. Now let’s just play a little bit with
the command line to get a feeling for it how

58
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,450
it works and let’s compare it to the maybe
more familiar graphical user interface.

59
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,940
On the left you can see the terminal. And
on the right you can see the default file

60
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,710
explorer which currently displays the content
of the home folder. In fact the terminal on

61
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,500
the left is in the same place!

62
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,060
The first part is the current user. After
the @ is the computer or host name. After

63
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,300
the colon you can find the current location.
And the tilde is an alias for your users home

64
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,110
folder. For example if you execute the pwd
command, it will display the current location,

65
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,780
which is the home of the user liveoverflow.
Before we look into more commands, let me

66
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,740
show you one of the most important source
of information for the linux system. It is

67
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,110
the Linux manual. So let’s type man followed
by what we are interested in. In this case

68
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,680
pwd. You should get familiar how those man
pages look like, because we will use them

69
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,150
a lot. Right here at the top it says that
pwd will print the name of the current working

70
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,000
directory.
At the bottom you get the information that

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,400
you can press h to display a help or q to
quit and get back to the command line. So

72
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,910
when you press h you will see the summary
of less commands. I will show you later what

73
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,810
less is, but for now just think of this as
some kind of text editor that displays file

74
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,660
content. And this editor uses key input for
navigation. So let’s press q to exit the

75
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,390
help, and q again to exit the manual.
Now I will quickly go over some commands to

76
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,890
navigate around the file system. If you don't
know them or would like to know more about

77
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,930
them, you should check out the man pages.

78
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,200
Let’s start with ls which will display the
files of the current folder. You can see it

79
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,770
looks almost the same, except the graphical
interface shows a shortcut to Examples, while

80
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:46,410
ls shows a examples.desktop file. That's weird.
Let’s use cat to look at the content of

81
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:52,150
the file and investigate this. Cat just prints
the file content in the terminal and you can

82
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,980
now see that this seems to be some kind of
special file, that defines a type link and

83
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,410
name Examples. So the terminal just displays
the actual files, while the graphical user

84
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,990
interface parses the example-content file
and displays it in a different way. This is

85
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,800
one reason why many people say that linux
command line is very simple because you don’t

86
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,460
have to know all those weird features that
are different in every program.

87
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,440
Now execute ls with the option L to display
the files as a list which also provides more

88
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,310
information like the file permissions, ownership
and date. The first character indicates if

89
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,810
the file is a directory.
Maybe you wonder why I say files, while they

90
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,090
are all directories. The reason for that is
that in Linux everything is a file.

91
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,770
Wikipedia even has an entry for “everything
is a file” and it reads.

92
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,060
This is a defining feature of Unix, and its
derivatives - a wide range of input/output

93
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,700
resources such as documents, directories,
hard-drives, modems, keyboards, printers and

94
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,460
even some inter-process and network communications
are simple streams of bytes exposed through

95
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,210
the filesystem - as a file. Over time we will
understand this better.

96
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:09,200
Now add the option 'a' to display all files.
'a' and 'l' are single character option switches,

97
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,580
which is indicated by the hyphen prefix. Doesn’t
matter if you combine them or specify them

98
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,740
separately.
Suddenly you see a lot more files that start

99
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,250
with a dot. Those dotfiles were hidden before.
Historically this was a bug and you can read

100
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,550
more about it in this post, but now it’s
a feature and dotfiles are often used for

101
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,710
config files.

102
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,990
Now let’s look at the filesystem. We can
use cd to change the directory. Let’s go

103
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,070
to the top of the hierarchical filesystem
which starts at slash. Now you can also see

104
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:43,339
that the tilde changed to the slash, which
is our new current location.

105
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,999
If you specify a path without a slash it’s
a relative path going forward from your current

106
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:52,199
location. If you have a slash, it will be
an absolute path. So here are just some examples.

107
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,749
Maybe you notice the dots and double dots
that I am using. If you look at the ls output

108
00:08:55,749 --> 00:09:01,049
again, you notice that there are two files
with dots. A single dot is referencing the

109
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:09,200
current directory. So 'ls' and 'ls .' is exactly
the same. A double dot goes one hierarchy

110
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:14,359
up. So when you are in your home directory
you can use two double dots to got to the

111
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,890
top.

112
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,209
Ok. Slow enough, let’s speed up a bit.

113
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,919
'mkdir' makes a new directory
'touch' makes a new empty file

114
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,390
'rm' deletes a file. If you want to delete
a folder you have to add the recursive option.

115
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:31,729
'echo' and a character sequence just prints
this text

116
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,010
'uname' and uname with different arguments
provide information about your machine

117
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,849
'll' is a short cut for 'ls' with multiple
parameters

118
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,840
'free' shows you the current memory usage
and with the parameter h the numbers will

119
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,879
be shown in human readable format
'df' shows file system disk space and again

120
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,929
with parameter h the numbers are in human
readable format

121
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:58,150
'ps' gives information about your currently
running processes. With parameters you can

122
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,799
also show all processes with memory usage,
cpu and more.

123
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,500
and id shows you your current user id

124
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:10,879
One last important feature to learn about
are pipes and redirections. Linux becomes

125
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,379
very powerful once you connect multiple commands
together.

126
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:18,969
For example echo prints a string. You can
redirect this output into a file by using

127
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,870
the arrow.

128
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,090
When you print the content of a file with
cat you can use the horizontal line or also

129
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:32,269
often called pipe to redirect the output from
“cat” into the input of another program.

130
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:38,759
For example you can pipe the output of the
'cat' command into the input of the 'hexdump'

131
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,259
command - a tool that shows you the actual
hex values behind each character. And here

132
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:51,199
the hex '0a' for example, or decimal ten.
You should start becoming familiar with hex,

133
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:56,089
because you will use it a lot. Check out the
manual for ascii characters. You can navigate

134
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:00,179
up and down with arrow keys. And exit with
q.

135
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,750
One last thing, you can press arrow key up
in the terminal to quickly enter previous

136
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:10,619
commands. And even more powerful is CTRL+R,
which opens a search prompt. Now we look for

137
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,040
the command where we used for hexdump, and
once it found it we can just hit Enter to

138
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,380
execute it. If you want to leave this prompt
or generally want to quit running programs,

139
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,239
you can hit CTRL+C.

140
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:32,480
Ok cool. That’s it for now so let’s shutdown
the system with “shutdown now”.

141
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,070
uh! but what is that. You must be root to
shutdown the machine. The root user or also

142
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:45,069
called superuser is very powerful, because
this user can do everything. But we are currently

143
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:49,839
the user liveoverflow. It’s good practice
to not use the root user all the time because

144
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,239
you can do a lot of damage. But there is a
command prefix called sudo, which elevates

145
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,640
your privileges. execute id with sudo and
you see you are liveoverflow. Execute id with

146
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:06,139
sudo, first enter your password, and then
you will see that you executed it as root.

147
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,999
So you can use that now to shutdown the VM.

148
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:11,649
See you next time when we will create our
first program.
